Sessel
======

Sessel is a cross-indexed RDF triple store for [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) featuring an RDF query engine, a SPARQL endpoint, import of and export to various RDF serialization formats, and a simple permission management.

This Node script serves as a proxy for Sessel because of CouchDB's lack of web services defined as documents. It uses the very same SPARQL engine that is used in the client-side GUI version of the SPARQL endpoint.
